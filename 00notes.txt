1.  Create a file with the masses, initial positions and initial velocities of the objects (planets, stars).
    Maybe use the createCluster programme to create a cluster of  stars.
    This progrmme has many parameters.  Please read the manual carefully.
    Call this file ?????.in (ie input file - eg data.in).

2.  Use nbody_sh1 to calculate the subsequent evolution of the system.  Call the output file ??.out

3.  Use createAnimation programme to create a series of images of the output data.

4.  Use the ImageMagick module "convert" to combine the separate images into an animated gif.
    ie.  convert *.png file.gif
